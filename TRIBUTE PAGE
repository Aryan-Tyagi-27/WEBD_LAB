   <div style="font-size:20px ;"> <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar[a] (22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician.<br>
       <p> Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions<br>
        to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including <br>
         solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.</p>
    <h2>SOME INFORMATION ABOUT SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN</h2>
    Srinivas Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician renowned for his extraordinary contributions to<br>
    number theory and mathematical analysis. Born in 1887, he was largely self-taught and developed<br>
    many groundbreaking results independently. His work attracted the attention of British<br>
    mathematician G.H. Hardy, leading to a fruitful collaboration at Cambridge University. Despite his<br>
    short life—he died at 32—Ramanujan's innovative theorems and formulas have had a lasting impact<br>
    on mathematics, continuing to inspire researchers today.</p> </div>
